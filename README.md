Code highlights
- 🤖 A GPU-accelerated [assisted robot teleoperation system](https://github.com/NVlabs/fast-explicit-teleop) I built at [Nvidia Research](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/srl/)
- 🦾 Systems work across [a warehouse picking workcell](https://github.com/au-rmr/aurmr_tahoma/commits/main?author=nickswalker), to an [office service robot](https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot/commits/master/?author=nickswalker) (including a [distro ROS1 package](https://github.com/utexas-bwi/knowledge_representation)), to an [adorable home social robot](https://github.com/hcrlab/kuri/commits/master?author=nickswalker) for various research projects
- 🧙 An [embedded reinforcement learner](https://github.com/nickswalker/ArduinoRL) (just 2KB of SRAM!)
- 🏃 Many fun running things with [Race Condition Running](https://github.com/raceconditionrunning/)
  -  🧠 An [automated scheduler](https://github.com/raceconditionrunning/relay-scheduler) for assigning runners to legs in relays
  -  🎥 A [vision-based lap-counting system](https://github.com/raceconditionrunning/visual-race-timing) for timing races
  -  ⛲ A WebGL-simulated fountain (live [here](https://raceconditionrunning.com/dm24)) and a 🚈 live-transit integrated route map (live [here](https://raceconditionrunning.com/lrr24)) for the [club site](https://github.com/raceconditionrunning/raceconditionrunning.github.io)
- ..and other toys like a:
  - 🎨 [Paper marbling simulation](https://github.com/nickswalker/marblizer) (live [here](https://marblizer.nickwalker.us))
  - 🔣 Recreation of [Seattle-area dot matrix displays](https://github.com/nickswalker/seattle-transit-dot-matrix)
